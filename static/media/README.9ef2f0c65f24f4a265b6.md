This page represents the front end of a bigger web application.
Its purpose is to emulate the deployment phase.  
Its contents, as of now, are a placeholder to make the application test-ready.  
This instance of the application doesn't work because Github pages doesn't support distributed client-server structure. Net errors are the expected behavior.

I made an actual deployment into my local network using port forwarding, and the application became fully functional worldwide.  
The ans function was working as a very weird one-number-only-broadcast chat tool. Goes to show the potential of the structure.  
This NAT configuration is not running anymore for obvious reasons.
