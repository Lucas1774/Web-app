# Full-stack web application

The purpose of this project is to provide an example of a simple web application with a back-end server and a front-end client. The application provides a calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations.  
You should know that everything in this file except this line was generated by ChatGPT3.5 prompted the directory tree, and then molded by me to correct or highlight some aspects. I left some parts untouched because it is funny.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to build this application:

- Git - Version control system used for managing source code.
- Java - Programming language used for developing the server-side application.
- Spring Boot - Framework used for building the server-side application and RESTful web services.
- Maven - Build automation tool used for managing dependencies and building the server-side application.
- JavaScript - Programming language used for developing the client-side application
- React - JavaScript library used for building the client-side application.
- npm - Package manager used for managing dependencies for the client-side application.
- Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment used for running the client-side application.
- MySQL - Relational database management system used for storing data.
- HTML - Markup language used for structuring the client-side application.
- CSS - Style sheet language used for styling the client-side application.
- Bootstrap - Front-end framework used for designing and styling web pages in the client-side application.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `client`: This directory contains the React.js client application code. The frontend application is built using the `create-react-app` tool (that was a wild guess by the AI, but spot on) and communicates with the backend server through RESTful API endpoints.
- `server`: This directory contains the Java Spring Boot server code. The backend application provides RESTful API endpoints that the client uses to perform operations on the calculator. The program receives user input, performs the requested calculation using a Solver class, and saves the results to a MySQL database for later retrieval. When the `ans` function of the calculator is called, the program retrieves the result from the database and sends it back to the front end.
- `database`: This directory contains a MySQL database that stores the result of the mathematical operation under two layers of authentication security and CORS policies (chatGPT did not infer this. Imagine).

## Installation and Usage

To run this application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Install Node.js and MySQL if not already installed
3. Start the MySQL server and create a new database
4. Update the database connection details in the `application.yml` file located in the `src/main/resources` directory of the backend server code
5. Update the IP address details and the server credentials with the ones of your choice in the `application.yml` and the `.env.local` files. If you are not planning on deploying your application you can and should leave the public IP address blank
6. Start the application server and client running the run.bat script or through any other mean
7. If you want to use the application over the internet you will need to forward the required ports from your router's NAT configuration. You might also need to set up your firewall rules to allow traffic within your LAN environment so both endpoints can communicate with each other

## Conclusion

Overall, this project demonstrates how different technologies can be combined to create a web-based application that provides a simple yet useful service. The use of React.js and Spring Boot in particular shows how front-end and back-end technologies can be used together to create a smooth and seamless user experience. This last sentence is flattering because I didn't write it.
